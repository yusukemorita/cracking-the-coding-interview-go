# Q. How would you design a stack which, in addition to `push` and `pop`, has a function `min` which returns the minimum element?  `push`, `pop` and `min` should all operate in O(1) time.

- △ Idea: just keep the minimum value in a variable
  - What happens when the minimum value is popped? The next smallest value must be found from within the stack, and this would not take O(1) time.
  - However, this could be considered O(1) time amortized
- × Idea: keep the order of all values in a separate list somehow
  - updating the order on `push` or `pop` would not take O(1) time
- ✅ Idea: keep track of extra data in each node
  - When a node with a new minimum value (NewMinNode) is pushed, if the minimum value is replaced, keep a pointer to the node that used to have the minimum value (OldMinNode). Then, when NewMinNode is pushed, use this pointer to replace the minimum value with OldMinNode.

## solution provided by book

1. Keep track of the current minimum in each node.
2. Use a separate stack to keep track of the minimums. When a node with the minimum value is popped, also pop a value from this separate stack. This is more space efficient than 1., as there will only be values added to this separate stack when the minimum value changes.
